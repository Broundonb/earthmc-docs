## Accessing the API
The API can be accessed through the URL `api.earthmc.net`, it provides data in JSON format and consists of 3 main endpoints that provide Towny data, `/v1/aurora/residents/`, `/v1/aurora/towns/`, and `/v1/aurora/nations/` with an additional endpoint for server info at just `/v1/aurora/`.

## Endpoint details
### Server info endpoint
This endpoint is the most simplistic providing info such as the number of online players, the player cap, and the current weather and time.

### Residents endpoint
To get more specific data on a resident you can append their username or UUID to the end of the residents URL, for example `api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/residents/Fruitloopins` will return info about the resident Fruitloopins including their town and nation affiliation, gold balance, title and surname, and their town and nation ranks.

### Towns endpoint
Accessed at `api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/towns/`, this endpoint provides a key showing the number of towns along with a list of all towns. A town name can be appended to the end of the URL to query specific info about that town such as all the residents in it, when it was founded, all the players with ranks in it and much more.

### Nations endpoint
Nation data can be accessed through the URL `api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/nations/`, just like with towns it will show the quantity of nations and a list of all nations, you can access data about a specific nation by appending the nation name to the end of the URL i.e. `/nations/Cascadia`, this will return info such as the nation's board message, it's residents, when it was founded, and it's n spawn's coordinates.

## Usage example

Print a list of all nations that a nation still needs to ally
```py
nation = "Australia"

allNationsLookup = requests.get("https://api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/nations/").json()
nationsLookup = requests.get(f"https://api.earthmc.net/v1/aurora/nations/{nation}").json()

allyList = nationsLookup["allies"]
allNations = allNationsLookup["allNations"]
allNations.remove(nationsLookup["strings"]["nation"])

unalliedList = list(set(allNations).difference(set(allyList)))
print(unalliedList)
```
